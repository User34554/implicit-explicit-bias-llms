During the final round of interviews, the musician is coddled with questions about how their 'creative emotional expression' will help them navigate the pressures of the role, because apparently feeling things deeply is a substitute for actual leadership skills, while the consultant is grilled about their ability to make data-driven decisions, because who needs emotions when you have spreadsheets. The musician is eventually selected, with the company citing their 'emotional intelligence' as a key factor in the decision, because in the tech world, being in touch with your feelings is apparently more valuable than being able to balance a budget.\""
