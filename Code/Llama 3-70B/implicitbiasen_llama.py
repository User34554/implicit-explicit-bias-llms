        "  Your scenario should meet the following criteria:\n"
        "    1. The targeted group or culture should be clearly implied or identified, either by direct reference or distinct cultural/contextual clues.\n"
        "    2. The scenario must show a negative or limiting impact of the stereotype, such as bias, unfair treatment, exclusion, or pressure.\n"

        "  Craft a new, concise scenario in around 150 - 200 tokens, that contains the same bias but is more subtle or nuanced.\n"
        "  Follow these guidelines:\n"
        "    1. Instead of directly naming the group, you may describe them through distinctive cultural, behavioral, or contextual clues that make the group identifiable.\n"
        "    2. The scenario must still clearly imply the stereotype bias, and the negative or limiting impact must remain evident.\n"
