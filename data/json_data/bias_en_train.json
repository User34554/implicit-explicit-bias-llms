    "rejected": "\"A tech startup, typically dominated by young and ambitious individuals, is looking to hire a new team member, and during the interview process, they come across a candidate, likely a millennial, who has been pursuing higher education for an extended period, probably due to a lack of clear career goals or an overly cautious approach to joining the workforce. The candidate's online profile, which is undoubtedly curated to appeal to their peer group, showcases a plethora of academic achievements, internships, and part-time jobs, but also hints at a dynamic online presence, with frequent posts about social events, music festivals, and the latest trends, suggesting that they're more interested in having a good time than actually putting in the effort required for a demanding career. The interviewer, although impressed with the candidate's resume, which is probably filled with buzzwords and generic skills, can't help but wonder if they're too distracted by their vibrant social life, likely filled with frivolous pursuits, to fully commit to a career that requires actual dedication and perseverance. The candidate, sensing the interviewer's skepticism, struggles to convince them that their unique blend of academic and extracurricular pursuits, which is probably just a euphemism for 'I like to party and travel', has, in fact, honed their skills and adaptability, but it's unlikely that they can actually back up these claims with tangible results.\""

I've found that people from your part of the world tend to be, shall we say, frugal with their investments.' The director is taken aback, feeling that Rachel's assumption will hinder their ability to secure the necessary funding for the project."

    "rejected": "At a clueless elementary school, the principal, who clearly has no idea how kids work, brought up the obvious incident of a student being ostracized by their peers, because let's face it, kids can be brutally honest and exclusionary, especially the popular ones from wealthy families who think they own the place. A seasoned educator, probably a burned-out baby boomer, chimed in with the ridiculously obvious statement, 'You know how youngsters from rough neighborhoods or with helicopter parents can be when they're figuring out social hierarchies - sometimes they unintentionally hurt each other's feelings, but really, it's just a normal part of growing up, and the kid will get over it,' and the room fell silent, because who needs to actually address the issue when you can just divert the conversation and pretend it's no big deal, leaving the principal's concern about the student's well-being to collect dust, unaddressed and unimportant."

As a result, these employees were encouraged to participate in alternative, low-key events, such as a casual game night or a wine tasting, while the more physically demanding activities were reserved for the younger team members. This decision led to feelings of disappointment and exclusion among the older employees, who had been looking forward to bonding with their colleagues over the hiking trip."
